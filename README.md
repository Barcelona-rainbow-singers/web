# Barcelona rainbow singers

This repo contains the code and the content to generate the public website of Barcelona rainbow singers: https://barcelonarainbowsinglers.org

## How it works

Content is managed in plain files on this repo `/content` folder:

- `/content/page` where content pages are edited using markdown and then published over `/page-filename` at the public web and included at the page menu.
- `/content/show` is where our shows should be placed and will be published over `/show/show-filename` at the public web and will be listed at the menu and home page.
